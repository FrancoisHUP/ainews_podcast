"a new alignment process and progress in online RL techniques" is all you need.

AI News for 12/5/2024-12/6/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, 433 Twitters and 31 Discords (206 channels, and 5628 messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 535 minutes. You can now tag @smol_ai for AINews discussions!

Meta AI, sensibly waiting for OpenAI to release an o1 finetuning waitlist, thankfully kept their sane versioning strategy and simply bumped their Llama minor version yet again to 3.3, this time matching 405B performance with their 70B model, using "a new alignment process and progress in online RL techniques". No papers of course.

Amazon Nova Pro had all of 3 days to sit and look pretty, but with Meta loudly advertising same performance at 12% of the cost, they have been smacked back down in the hierarchy of price-to-performance ratios.
